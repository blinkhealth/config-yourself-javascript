## Develop `@blinkhealth/config-yourself`

`@blinkhealth/config-yourself` is tested to work with node >= 8.12.0, so we should any such version available before we begin hacking.

```sh
# Install the dependencies
yarn install --dev
```

## Running tests

```sh
# run unit tests
yarn test

# run one test suite
yarn test -- src/parse/env.test.ts
```
